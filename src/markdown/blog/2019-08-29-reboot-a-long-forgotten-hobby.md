# Reboot a long forgotten hobby
<small>written on 29th August, 2019 by Cem Derin</small>

When I was a teenager I discovered a comic book store near my school. It was like a candy shop to me and I visited it nearly 
on a daily basis. Beside any kind of comic books the store also had decent amount of table top games. That was the first time
I got in contact with Games Workshops Warhammer 40,000. I was hooked immediately and a few months later I got the starter box
as a birthday present. For nearly a decade painting miniatures and gather at shabby club homes to play with them was my life content.

While getting older, getting smashed, girls, and everything else was more important to me than sticking to my table and painting miniatures. 
Over the years I lost interest, sold most of my miniatures and lost the rest of them. Occasionally I kept track about the developments, new releases
but never really planned to get back.

Until now. A few weeks ago I spontaneously hit a Games Workshop Store and bought the recent Warhammer 40,000 starter box. I well planned how to
paint my Plague Marines and finished the first squad a few days ago. I'm not exactly satisfied, but it's a hundred times better than anything what I did
as a teenager. 

I plan to post updates here. I need to figure out how to display images of my minis. Meanwhile, check out this very neat
(german) podcast, which helped me a lot to get back into being a full fledged nerd: [Die Hobbyisten](https://www.diehobbyisten.net/)
